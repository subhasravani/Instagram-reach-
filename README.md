## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze Instagram reach data to understand the factors influencing post performance and audience engagement. By examining metrics such as likes, comments, hashtags, post timing, and reach, the project seeks to:

- Identify trends in Instagram reach over time and across different types of posts.
- Understand the impact of hashtags, posting time, content type, and audience demographics on reach and engagement.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations for optimizing content to maximize reach and engagement.
- Build predictive models to estimate the expected reach or engagement of future posts.

## Data

The project utilizes an Instagram reach dataset ("instagram_reach.csv") containing information about various Instagram posts, including the number of likes, followers, hashtags used, and the time since the post was made.

## Methodology

The project follows a typical data science workflow:

1. **Data Loading:** Load the Instagram reach data from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to understand its characteristics, including data types, summary statistics, missing values, and distributions of key variables.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
4. **Data Wrangling:** Prepare the data for analysis and modeling by converting data types, extracting features, and creating new variables.
5. **Data Analysis:** Analyze the relationship between different variables and post performance using statistical methods and visualizations.
6. **Data Visualization:** Create visualizations to illustrate key findings from the data analysis.
7. **Feature Engineering:** Prepare the data for model training by performing feature engineering, such as one-hot encoding and scaling.
8. **Data Splitting:** Split the engineered features into training, validation, and testing sets.
9. **Model Training:** Train a linear regression model to predict post performance based on the engineered features.
10. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).

## Findings

- A weak positive correlation was observed between follower count and the number of likes received on a post.
- A weak negative correlation was observed between hashtag count and likes, suggesting that a large number of hashtags may not always lead to higher engagement.
- The 'Time since posted' column presented significant challenges, hindering a proper assessment of posting time's influence on engagement and reach trends.
- The trained linear regression model exhibits poor performance, indicating the need for further model improvement or exploring alternative modeling approaches.

## Insights and Next Steps

- Investigate hashtag strategies, potentially focusing on more relevant and targeted hashtags, or fewer, higher-quality ones. Consider the potential confounding factors at play.
- Improve data quality by addressing the issues with the 'Time since posted' column. Accurate time data is essential for understanding posting time's effect on engagement.
- Explore alternative data sources or formats if the current data is irrecoverable.
- Explore other potential issues in the data, including outliers and missing values that may not have been addressed.
- Develop more sophisticated models or explore other machine learning algorithms to improve predictive performance.
